#A Real Challenge

Old MacDonald had a farm, and on that farm she had a square-shaped pasture, and on that pasture she had a cow that was prone to escape. So now Old MacDonald wants to set up a fence around the pasture. Given the area of the pasture, how long a fence does Old MacDonald need to buy?
###Input
The input consists of a single integer aa (1≤a≤10181≤a≤1018), the area in square meters of Old MacDonald’s pasture.

###Output
Output the total length of fence needed for the pasture, in meters. The length should be accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most 10−610−6.
