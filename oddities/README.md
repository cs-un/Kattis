#Oddities

Some numbers are just, well, odd. For example, the number 3 is odd, because it is not a multiple of two. Numbers that are a multiple of two are not odd, they are even. More precisely, if a number nn can be expressed as n=2∗kn=2∗k for some integer kk, then nn is even. For example, 6=2∗36=2∗3 is even.

Some people get confused about whether numbers are odd or even. To see a common example, do an internet search for the query “is zero even or odd?” (Don’t search for this now! You have a problem to solve!)

Write a program to help these confused people.

###Input
Input begins with an integer 1≤n≤201≤n≤20 on a line by itself, indicating the number of test cases that follow. Each of the following nn lines contain a test case consisting of a single integer −10≤x≤10−10≤x≤10.

###Output
For each xx, print either ‘xx is odd’ or ‘xx is even’ depending on whether xx is odd or even.
