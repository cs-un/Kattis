Mirko has found an old chessboard and a set of pieces in his attic. Unfortunately, the set contains only white pieces, and apparently an incorrect number of them. A set of pieces should contain:

One king
One queen
Two rooks
Two bishops
Two knights
Eight pawns
Mirko would like to know how many pieces of each type he should add or remove to make a valid set.

###Input
The input consists of 66 integers on a single line, each between 00 and 1010 (inclusive). The numbers are, in order, the numbers of kings, queens, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns in the set Mirko found.

###Output
Output should consist of 66 integers on a single line; the number of pieces of each type Mirko should add or remove. If a number is positive, Mirko needs to add that many pieces. If a number is negative, Mirko needs to remove pieces.
