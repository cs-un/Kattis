#Pig Latin
Ancay youyay eakspay igpay atinlay? (Can you speak pig latin?) If you can’t, here are the rules:

If a word begins with a consonant, take all of the letters before the first vowel and move them to the end of the word, then add ay to the end of the word. Examples: pig →→ igpay, there →→ erethay.
If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, or y), simply add yay to the end of the word. For this problem, y is always a vowel. Examples: and →→ andyay, ordinary →→ ordinaryyay.
Although there are many variants of Pig Latin (such as Kedelkloppersprook in Germany), for this problem we will always use the rules described above.
